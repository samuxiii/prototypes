To-do:
- [x] Run pong environment
- [x] Gather knowledge about RL
- [ ] :point_right: Neural network policy gradient
  - [x] Conv2d + Dense + softmax
  - [-] Relu + softmax -> action selection
  - [-] Tanh + mse -> reward prediction 
- [x] Training (colab)
- [x] Check (some tests)
- [ ] Update code from notebook
